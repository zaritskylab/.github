## Welcome to the Zaritsky Lab GitHub

Motivated by fundamental questions in cell biology our lab produces biological insights along with specialized analytic tools that reveal hidden patterns in cell imaging data. This GitHub organization serves the purpose to store and maintain the products of our research.

* [muscle-formation-prediction](https://github.com/zaritskylab/muscle-formation-prediction) - Machine learning inference of continuous single-cell state transitions during myoblast differentiation and fusion.
* [multiplexed-imaging-motifs-visualiser](https://github.com/zaritskylab/multiplexed-imaging-motifs-visualiser) - Motif Visualizer for Multiplexed Imaging. A specialized tool designed to enhance the analysis and visualization of multiplexed imaging data.
